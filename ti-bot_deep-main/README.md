# TI-Bot Deep: AI Assistant Pipeline

A complete implementation of an intelligent AI assistant system that helps users with technical questions, troubleshooting, and information retrieval across various enterprise tools and knowledge bases.

## üéØ What is TI-Bot Deep?

TI-Bot Deep is an updated AI assistant that include  context, remembers conversations, and provides responses by combining multiple AI technologies:

- **Knowledge Base Search**: Finds relevant information from documentation and previous conversations
- **Memory System**: Remembers what you've discussed across sessions
- **Multi-Agent Processing**: Uses specialized AI agents for different types of questions
- **Enterprise Integration**: Connects to tools like Jira, GitLab, Confluence, and more

## ÔøΩ How It Works

### Simple User Flow
1. **Ask a Question**: You send a message to TI-Bot
2. **Context Understanding**: The system analyzes your question and recalls relevant past conversations
3. **Smart Search**: Searches through knowledge bases, documentation, and enterprise tools
4. **Intelligent Response**: Combines information and provides a helpful, contextual answer
5. **Memory Storage**: Saves the conversation for future reference

### Key Components

**Knowledge Base Service (Hades)**
- Stores and searches through technical documentation
- Uses advanced text processing to understand content
- Provides relevant information based on your questions

**AI Agent Service (Zion)**
- Manages conversations and maintains context
- Coordinates between different tools and data sources
- Generates intelligent responses using large language models

**Memory System**
- Remembers conversations across sessions
- Learns from interactions to improve responses
- Maintains user preferences and context

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Docker (for easy setup)
- Basic terminal/command line knowledge

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd ti-bot_deep

# Start the system with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# The AI assistant will be available at:
# - Main service: http://localhost:8000
# - Knowledge base: http://localhost:8088
```

### Using the AI Assistant
Once running, you can interact with TI-Bot through:
- Web API endpoints
- Direct HTTP requests
- Integration with chat platforms like Slack

## üí° Use Cases

**Technical Support**
- Troubleshoot code errors and issues
- Find documentation and best practices
- Get step-by-step guidance for complex tasks

**Information Retrieval**
- Search across multiple knowledge bases
- Find relevant tickets, issues, or discussions
- Access enterprise tool data quickly

**Contextual Assistance**
- Continue conversations from where you left off
- Get personalized responses based on your history
- Receive suggestions based on your patterns

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

TI-Bot Deep consists of two main systems working together:

**Enhanced Pipeline**
- Advanced memory capabilities
- Better context understanding
- Improved response quality
- Cross-session conversation continuity

**Baseline Pipeline** 
- Basic question-answering functionality
- Simple knowledge base search
- Standard AI responses

Both systems include:
- RESTful APIs for easy integration
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Scalable microservice architecture
- Enterprise security features

### üîç Baseline Pipeline Reference

Need to understand how the baseline Hades + Zion stack moves data from the HTTP edge to the knowledge base and back? Start with the [Baseline Pipeline Flow guide](docs/baseline-pipeline.md) for a box-and-arrow walkthrough plus file-level pointers for every stage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Customization

### Configuration
The system can be customized through environment variables and configuration files:
- Database connections
- AI model settings
- Memory system parameters
- Integration endpoints

### Extension Points
- Add new enterprise tool integrations
- Customize response templates
- Implement domain-specific knowledge processing
- Extend memory and context capabilities

### API Integration
```bash
# Example: Ask a question via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "How do I fix a Python import error?"}'
```

## üìö What's Included

- **Complete AI Assistant Pipeline**: Ready-to-deploy intelligent assistant
- **Memory System**: Conversational context and learning capabilities  
- **Knowledge Integration**: Connects to documentation and enterprise tools
- **API Endpoints**: Easy integration with existing systems
- **Docker Support**: Simplified deployment and scaling
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples

## ü§ù Support & Contribution
